NODE(!!!)
    Run code directly on machine instead of on browser

    RUNNING JS CODE WITH NODE
        either
            node filename.js / node => puts you in REPL, runs like console.log() 

    Module System
        Need to use it to share .js files through node 

        it ALL moves on export/require function
        
        function(exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname)
            exports-basically, module.exports
            require-Function to get access to the exports from another file
            module-Object that defines some props+info about the current file
            __filename-full path+file of this file (from which you are NODING)
            __dirname-full path of this file (from which you are NODING) 

                require function and module object are two most important parts of the node function, it's how files/code get shared around
