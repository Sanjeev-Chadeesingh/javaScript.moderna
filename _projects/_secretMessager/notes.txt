ENCODING

ASCII Character Codes - encoding with integers 0-127

Base64 character codes - encoding with integers 0-63

URL STUFF
    hash is typically where data we want to use will be stored, not really relevant to a backend server

    window.location => object with props, defines current URL you're looking at 
        window.location stringified returns just the URL inside a string 
            we'll be adding a hash after we stringify window.location, making it a usable link!!
