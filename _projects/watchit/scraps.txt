stdio
    TERMINAL starts up new program, or creates new process
    -3 communication channels whenever you start a program 
        stdin - used to receive info directly from terminal, then, program emits info over other 2 channels
            if program is running, info is sent to stdin
        stdout - used to communicate any normal logs
            console.logs, output from program, taking info and communicating back to terminal 
        stderr - used to throw error of any kind
            all errors are written to this channel 

        childProcess
            these need a place to send their out/err and receive their in
                child_process allows you to wire 3 channels and send them up to the parentProcess, eventually up to the terminal 

        THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF stdio: 'inherit'
