stdio
    TERMINAL starts up new program, or creates new process
    -3 communication channels whenever you start a program 
        stdin - used to receive info directly from terminal, then, program emits info over other 2 channels
            if program is running, info is sent to stdin
        stdout - used to communicate any normal logs
            console.logs, output from program, taking info and communicating back to terminal 
        stderr - used to throw error of any kind
            all errors are written to this channel 

        childProcess
            these need a place to send their out/err and receive their in
                child_process allows you to wire 3 channels and send them up to the parentProcess, eventually up to the terminal 
        THIS IS THE PURPOSE OF stdio: 'inherit'

    Running Code Starting Up Within Our Program
        running programs started up within our application
            shell-when another program is running simultaneously with yours/
                think terminal
                    -opening terminal is opening 2 things at the same time, shell included
            stream-how info from stdio gets pulled from childProcess and sent to parentProcess
            exec-Shell no Stream, command executed with Shell. 
            execFile-no Shell, single arg at a time, no piping into other files
            spawn-no Shell 
            fork-no Shell, just for running node.js process, and parent can communicate with child, used mostly for web servers
