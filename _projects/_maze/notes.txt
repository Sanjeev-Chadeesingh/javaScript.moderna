Building our Maze
    pick a random starting cell
        then take a look at cell's neighbors, four possible (grid of cells)
            pick one of four neighbors, and remove wall between origin cell and first neighbor cell
                look at this sibling's four cells, but sans the origin cell
                    pick another sibling, with 3 possible moves, moving the wall between the cells with each possible pick
            if we've moved through all possibly traversed cells and are cornered, we move to the batch of cells that haven't been traversed via backtracking, looking for cells we haven't been through

GRID 
    2 dimensional array of rows and columns
        cells in rows are partitioned by verticals
        cells in columns are partitioned by horizontals
            horizontals and verticals are arrays that will contain booleans
                true: no wall
                false: is a wall 
    3 array implementation (grid array, vertical array, horizontal array)
        Grid => 2d array with all walls set to false
